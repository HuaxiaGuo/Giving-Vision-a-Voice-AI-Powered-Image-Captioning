Annotate images with text

Millions of images are published with little or no accompanying text. This absence of descriptive metadata limits search-engine discoverability, impairs digital accessibility for users with visual disabilities, and forces businesses to invest in costly manual annotation.

purpose & use cases
E-commerce: Auto-captioning product photos for listings on Amazon, eBay, or Taobao.

Digital accessibility: Our AI not only generates image captions but can also read them aloud to support visually impaired users — similar to how Instagram adds alt-text for screen readers.

Smart photo management: Apps like Google Photos use similar tech to enable searchable image libraries (“dog in snow”, “birthday party”).

Surveillance & safety: Describing security footage for incident reports
